## About

This game was developed as part of a course during my bachelor's (the course was called 'Game Development 2'). **The game was made with Unity and coded in C# (.NET).**

This arena brawler game is intended to be played with up to 4 players on the couch in front of a TV, it's played using a console controller. Players pick up various weapons and try to knock out their opponents, it's a fast-paced action game where the last man standing is the winner.

## My contribution

I was responsible for implementing the controls for the controller and the keyboard, I also helped implement the local multiplayer system. I also implemented VFX into the game and made sure the VFX worked properly, I also made a few variations of some VFX and implemented them in the game.
